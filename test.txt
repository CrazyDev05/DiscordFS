Sit here, Marty. Huh? You too. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Doc, you gotta help-

Yeah. Yoo. Yeah, sure, okay. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Keys?

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Who is that guy. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Leave her alone, you bastard. No, Doc.

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Get your meat hooks off of me. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Are you okay? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.

Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Alright, I'm ready. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Hello. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

You're gonna be in the car with her. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hello. I just wanna use the phone. Did you hurt your head?

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Crazy drunk drivers. Hello, Jennifer. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. I guarantee it.

You'll find out in thirty years. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Right, I got it. No, why, what's a matter?

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Did you hurt your head?

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?

Excuse me. I followed you. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Yeah, who are you? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

And he could sleep in my room. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Yeah, exactly. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Watch it, Goldie. What? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Maybe you were adopted. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Nothing's coming to my mind. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. The hell you doing to my car? Who are you? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Right check, Doc.

Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. How about a ride, Mister?

It's my dad. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Flux capacitor.

No. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Uh, Doc. What, what, ma?

Ahh. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. And he could sleep in my room. No.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Yeah. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

He's a very strange young man. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Lorenzo, where're you keys? Why is she gonna get angry with you? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. I have a feeling too. I will. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. This is for all you lovers out there.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Say that again. Ah well, sort of. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Are those my clocks I hear?

Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Are you gonna order something, kid? Uh, well, I gotta go. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Leave her alone, you bastard. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Are you gonna order something, kid? I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Oh.

What? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Actually, people call me Marty. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? It's a board with wheels.

Wrecked? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. C'mon. Marty, will we ever see you again? I don't wanna see you in here again.

We do now. Well, she's not doing a very good job. What you got under here? Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Yeah, it's 8:00.

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I'll call you tonight. Good morning. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. I'm gonna be at the dance.

That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. I, I don't know. Ahh. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? I can't play.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? He's your brother, Mom. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Its good.

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? You'll find out. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Thanks, thanks a lot.

Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Doc.

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Ah, honey, your first novel. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Hi.

George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Huh? How about a ride, Mister? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?

Where were we. Stop it. I hope so. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.

McFly. That's a big bruise you have there. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. What, I don't get what happened.

C'mon. I think we need a rematch. Are you sure about this storm? And he could sleep in my room. Which one's your pop?

You okay, is everything alright? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. I have a feeling too. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.

Yeah, who are you? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Precisely. I followed you. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Oh. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Stop it. Jesus, you smoke too? this has gotta be a dream. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Never? Ahh. Ahh. He's an absolute dream. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Precisely. What, what, ma? That's right. Jesus, you smoke too?

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Nothing. Are you sure about this storm? No, bastards. Uh?

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Well gee, I don't know. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Ah well, sort of. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah, it's in the back. Scram, McFly.

Jesus, you smoke too? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Erased from existence. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. That's right. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

Uh, Doc. I think I know exactly what you mean. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Marty, will we ever see you again?

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Well, they're bigger than me.

Okay. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Ahh. Ahh. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Hello.

So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Hey. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Right. Marty, why are you so nervous?

Right, and where am I gonna be? Don't say a word. I haven't Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Jesus. Good morning. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Will you take care of that? Ahh.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. What? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Why is she gonna get angry with you? I'll get it back to you, alright?

That's right. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? No, not yet. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.

Well, she's not doing a very good job. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? What a nightmare.

Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. The flux capacitor. Don't tell me anything. Who? Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Huh? He's a peeping tom. Dad. Excuse me. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Well gee, I don't know. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Marty, are you alright?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Marty, you made it. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Hello.

Ohh, no. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Marty. Marty. Marty. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. No.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Keys? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. What you got under here?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Alright, I'm ready. Now Biff, don't con me.

And he could sleep in my room. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. It's a board with wheels. No, why, what's a matter?

Holy shit. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Why is she gonna get angry with you? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. No, bastards. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Stop it. He's a very strange young man. It's a board with wheels. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Ronald Reagon. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. What a nightmare. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Well, they're bigger than me.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Huh? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Let's get him. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Uh, coast guard. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Aw yeah, everything is great. C'mon, c'mon. Leave her alone, you bastard. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.

Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. I'll call you tonight. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Don't say a word. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Well, they're bigger than me. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together?

About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Right, I got it. Mom, Dad. Lorenzo, where're you keys? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

Stop it. I'll get it back to you, alright? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Right about here.

You don't understand. Yeah, exactly. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

George. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yet. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Jesus.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Bet your ass it works. I'll get it back to you, alright? Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Excuse me. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? I guarantee it. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

Well gee, I don't know. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Look, you gotta listen to me. Oh yes sir.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Where were we. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? This is for all you lovers out there.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? You're George McFly. Are you okay? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I followed you.

Excuse me. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. I have to tell you about the future. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Yeah, he's right here. I just wanna use the phone. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. What?

Damn. I'm late for school. What? Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. That's George McFly? Who are you?

Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? I've gotta go. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. George. George. Well, this is a radiation suit.

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. What, what is it hot? This sounds pretty heavy. Good morning, Mom. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

Ahh. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Uh, I think so. Don't tell me anything. No, why, what's a matter?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Marty, will we ever see you again? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? No, Biff, you leave her alone. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, Biff. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

I'm gonna ram him. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Right.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? You're gonna be in the car with her. Marty, that was very interesting music. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?

Nothing. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Oh yes sir. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. What did you say?

Alright, punk, now- No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Hi.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Marty, that was very interesting music. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Oh. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.

That's a big bruise you have there. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Are you sure about this storm? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Doc, is that a de-

Right. Yeah, it's 8:00. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. The storm. A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. What? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Children.

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Right. Ah well, sort of. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Ah well, sort of. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Get your meat hooks off of me. What? Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. It's a board with wheels. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Listen, Doc. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. this has gotta be a dream. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Yeah, exactly. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Wait a minute.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Because, you might regret it later in life. Ah, honey, your first novel. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Holy shit. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Ah, where're my pants?

It's a board with wheels. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Next, please. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. He's a very strange young man.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Marty, you made it. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Right. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. We never would have fallen in love. Uh, I think so. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Uncle Jailbird Joey? I have to tell you about the future.

Marty, that was very interesting music. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Why not?

Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Aw yeah, everything is great. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Lorenzo, where're you keys?

Say that again. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.

You okay, is everything alright? It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Let's put him in there. Oh. Aw yeah, everything is great.

What, what is it hot? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Where? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Let's go.

George. George. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Quiet. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Without any sugar. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Is she pretty? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Lorraine, are you up there? Doc? Quiet. George: you ever think of running for class president? What's going on? Where have you been all week?

Listen, Doc. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. You bet. I followed you. I haven't

No, Doc. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Why not?

Well, she's not doing a very good job. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. What's a rerun? You know what I do in those situations? C'mon.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. The storm. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

Children. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Well, they're bigger than me. Who? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

She's just trying to keep you respectable. What's a rerun? Wow, you must be rich. George. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

You'll find out. Uh, well, I gotta go. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Yeah. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.

I said the keys are in here. Huh? Hey. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. The future, it's where you're going?

yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? No. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Yoo. Looks like a airplane, without wings. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. I just wanna use the phone. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. What Lorraine, what? Are you sure about this storm? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Are those my clocks I hear? Which one's your pop?

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Which one's your pop? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?

You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Yeah, exactly. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

What's a rerun? Who are you? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

What? She's just trying to keep you respectable. I hope so. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. I, I don't know. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Okay Doc, this is it. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.

No, I refuse to except the responsibility. I'm gonna be at the dance. Scram, McFly. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Right, I got it.

What, what is it hot? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. You do? Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Yeah. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Hello.

Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. George: you ever think of running for class president? Alright, punk, now- Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Hello, Jennifer.

Ahh. Ahh. Precisely. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? C'mon.

Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? You broke it. Wow, look at him go.

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Yeah. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. No, why, what's a matter? Scram, McFly.

Excuse me. Who? Doc, is that a de- Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. What about George?

Um, well it's a delorean, right? Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. No, not yet. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? George, help me, please.

Lorraine, are you up there? We never would have fallen in love. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. This is for all you lovers out there. That's good advice, Marty.

What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Without any sugar. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

this has gotta be a dream. Um, well it's a delorean, right? What did I just say? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? George, help me, please. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks a lot, kid.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Thanks. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Thanks a lot, kid. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. He's a very strange young man. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Yeah, who are you? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?

I followed you. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Are you okay? Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Marty, you made it. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Whoa, this is heavy. Jennifer. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Lorraine, are you up there? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

Ahh. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

Why not? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Marty, why are you so nervous? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Doc, you gotta help-

What, I don't get what happened. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Alright, take it up, go. Doc. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. What's the meaning of this.

You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Well, Biff. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

How about a ride, Mister? Which one's your pop? Doc? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it.

Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Huh? What's a rerun? Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

How's your head? That's George McFly? What? Yeah. It's a board with wheels.

I, I don't know. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Right. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? C'mon, c'mon.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Whoa, wait, Doc. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

We all make mistakes in life, children Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. I'll call you tonight. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Doc. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Well, they're bigger than me. George. George. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Alright, we're the pinheads. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.

this has gotta be a dream. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Listen, Doc. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Perfect, just perfect.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. What about George? Unroll their fire. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Say that again.

He's your brother, Mom. Who's are these? There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Do you mind if we park for a while? The flux capacitor.

Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Excuse me. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? I followed you.

Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.

What? Will you take care of that? I'll call you tonight. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. What you got under here? What's the meaning of this. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo

Alright, we're the pinheads. Science Fiction Theater. Thank you. In about thirty years. Thanks, thanks a lot. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

Thank you. In about thirty years. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Nothing's coming to my mind. Thanks a lot, kid.

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Stop it. Stop it. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

What? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Yeah, he's right here. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Well gee, I don't know. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Right. Are you sure about this storm?

McFly. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Thanks, thanks a lot. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Yeah, exactly. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Yeah, well history is gonna change.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yet. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Nothing's coming to my mind. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Well, Biff. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- You'll find out in thirty years. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Weight has nothing to do with it. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. What, well you mean like a date? We do now. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Watch it, Goldie.

That ain't no airplane, look. About how far ahead are you going? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Oh. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Perfect, just perfect. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. You know what I do in those situations?

Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. No. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Oh. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

No. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Which one's your pop? Damn. I'm late for school. The flux capacitor.

I followed you. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Okay Doc, this is it. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Sit here, Marty. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Jesus, you smoke too? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

Oh, what I meant to day was- Don't tell me anything. What, what? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. No, Doc.

It's about the future, isn't it? Alright, I'm ready. You know what I do in those situations? Ah, honey, your first novel. I will.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Hello. It's a board with wheels.

I guarantee it. No, not yet. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Well uh, good, fine. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

You have this thing hooked up to the car? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Back to the future. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

This sounds pretty heavy. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. George, help me, please. Who's are these? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. You bet.

A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. What did your mother ever see in that kid? this has gotta be a dream. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Uh, look me up when you get there. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. This sounds pretty heavy. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. What did I just say? Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Lorraine. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Marty, is that you?

Never mind that now, never mind that now. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda What, well you mean like a date? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?

Maybe you were adopted. Why do you keep following me around? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Wow, you must be rich. This sounds pretty heavy.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Science Fiction Theater. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Why not? Doc. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Marty, that was very interesting music. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

Doc. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. It's a board with wheels. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together?

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo Hi, Marty. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Excuse me.

Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Doc.

Did you hurt your head? Uh, Doc. Science Fiction Theater. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

I have a feeling too. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- And where's my reports? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Marty, such a nice name. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Just finishing up the second coat now. Hey. Now Biff, don't con me. Yeah, he's right here.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Right about here.

Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Science Fiction Theater. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Scram, McFly. Biff.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Nothing. I'll get it back to you, alright? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Ah, where're my pants?

That's him. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Don't say a word.

Really. Yeah, where does he live? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Hello, Jennifer.

He's your brother, Mom. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Right about here. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Yeah, sure, okay. The hell you doing to my car?

Precisely. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. What a nightmare. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Yeah. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Wait a minute. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Yeah. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Lorenzo, where're you keys? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. We never would have fallen in love.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Yeah, he's right here.

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Doc, she didn't even look at him.

It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Alright, punk, now- Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.

Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Who's are these? A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Where does he come from? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Holy shit. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. That's George McFly? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? You have this thing hooked up to the car? We do now. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Doc.

whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. No, not yet. Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?

I followed you. I'll get it back to you, alright? Let's go. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Doc?

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Next, please. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. I just wanna use the phone. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Yeah. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. I have a feeling too. Holy shit. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Okay, but I don't know what to say. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. What, I don't get what happened. Doc. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. No, why, what's a matter? Wrecked? When did this happen and- No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Flux capacitor.

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Huh? Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.

Yeah. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. You'll find out. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Uh, coast guard. You'll find out in thirty years. The future, it's where you're going? Right. What?

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Don't tell me anything. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Because, you might regret it later in life.

Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Wrecked? When did this happen and-

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Ahh. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Marty, that was very interesting music. What?

Yeah okay. Okay. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Unroll their fire. You'll find out. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Yeah, well history is gonna change. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Hi. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. The hell you doing to my car? Are you sure about this storm?

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Don't tell me anything. Hello. The flux capacitor. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

What about George? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Good morning, Mom. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

No, bastards. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Good morning. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? What about George?

Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Yeah. Don't say a word. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Right, and where am I gonna be?

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Wrecked? When did this happen and- And he could sleep in my room. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Hello, Jennifer. I don't wanna see you in here again. What did I just say?

What Lorraine, what? Okay. Why not? Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Hi.

Doc. Holy shit. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Ah, where're my pants?

Well, Biff. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Where does he come from? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Get your meat hooks off of me.

No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Why not? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

I've gotta go. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Yeah, he's right here. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? George.

I think we need a rematch. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Take care. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Without any sugar. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

Yeah, I think maybe you do. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. That's a big bruise you have there. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

I think we need a rematch. Huh? C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Where? Uh, Doc.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Doc. Next, please. What did I just say? Uh, yeah.

And where's my reports? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. What, I don't get what happened. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Oh.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. George. George. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Never? Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

What? Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

You have this thing hooked up to the car? Where does he come from? Shit. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

What, what? Yeah, well history is gonna change. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

You got a permit for that? No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Will you take care of that? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. I said the keys are in here. Hello, Jennifer.

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. What?

Ahh. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? I'm gonna be at the dance. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- That's him.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. C'mon. Right. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.

It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Uh, I think so. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? C'mon, c'mon let's go. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. I think I know exactly what you mean. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? What's with the life preserver?

Wrecked? When did this happen and- No, why, what's a matter? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Hi, Marty. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Wow, you must be rich. this has gotta be a dream.

Yeah, gimme a Tab. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Stop it. Calvin. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. What? Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.

Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Mom, is that you? You got a permit for that? Take care. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Breakfast.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? No, why, what's a matter? Uncle Jailbird Joey? Wow, you must be rich. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Bet your ass it works.

Well uh, good, fine. Precisely. Is she pretty? What, I don't get what happened. Breakfast.

What? Hi. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Ahh. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Alright, we're the pinheads. It's my dad.

Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Uncle Jailbird Joey? Don't tell me anything. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Yeah.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Yeah. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Yeah. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Yeah, it's 8:00. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Excuse me. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Well, I guess that's everything. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Excuse me. Where the hell are they. Calvin. Right, I got it. That's good advice, Marty.

Biff. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. The hell you doing to my car? Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Damn. I'm late for school. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?

Right. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Let's go. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. It's my dad. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Uh, Doc.

Which one's your pop? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Are those my clocks I hear? You okay, is everything alright? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

Leave her alone, you bastard. Holy shit. Huh? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.

I have to tell you about the future. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Doc. Ahh.

I just wanna use the phone. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Excuse me. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. What was it, George, bird watching?

Are those my clocks I hear? You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Right. I have a feeling too.

Where the hell are they. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

That ain't no airplane, look. No, not yet. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Mom, Dad. Sit here, Marty.

Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. You bet. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Yeah, sure, okay. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Who is that guy. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Uh, Doc.

Marty. Marty. Marty. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Its good. He's alright.

You bet. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? I think I know exactly what you mean. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Ah, where're my pants? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Breakfast. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Doc, wait. No, bastards. Whoa, this is heavy. What, what is it hot?

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. What you got under here? You'll find out in thirty years. Back to the future. Which one's your pop?

Well uh, good, fine. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Stop it. We do now. Go. Go.

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Huh? Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Hello, Jennifer. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Huh? It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. I'll call you tonight. Mom, is that you? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Right. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Shit. How about a ride, Mister? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Leave her alone, you bastard. Ah, where're my pants?

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Never?

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Thanks, thanks a lot. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Science Fiction Theater. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Doc, wait. No, bastards. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

Weight has nothing to do with it. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Hey. Breakfast.

So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Looks like a airplane, without wings. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Uh, Doc. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Say that again. Doc, is that a de- Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Yeah. Thank you. In about thirty years. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

Who's are these? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Marty, why are you so nervous? Right check, Doc. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.

What? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? No. Is she pretty? Weight has nothing to do with it.

Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Where's Einstein, is he with you? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

Save the clock tower. Uh, Doc. Children. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.

Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. No. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Are you gonna order something, kid?

Ah. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Ah well, sort of.

My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Where were we.

Because, you might regret it later in life. You'll find out. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Save the clock tower. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Right. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Right. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Wait a minute. Hello. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Precisely. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Marty. Marty. Marty.

Right. Who, who? Good morning. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Flux capacitor.

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Who are you?

Your, your right. George. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Jesus, you smoke too? Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? C'mon, c'mon let's go. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. What, what? We do now. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Wrecked? When did this happen and-

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. I said the keys are in here. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Nothing's coming to my mind. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Thanks. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Looks like a airplane, without wings. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Go. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Looks like a airplane, without wings. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Well, they're bigger than me. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Biff. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

Look, you gotta listen to me. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Excuse me. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. I can't play. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Whoa, wait, Doc.

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Yeah. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Lorraine.

Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? What?

Marty, such a nice name. Lorenzo, where're you keys? George. George. Alright, punk, now- What's with the life preserver?

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Doc. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Nothing's coming to my mind.

Nothing's coming to my mind. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Marty you gotta come back with me. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. I hope so.

Excuse me. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? About how far ahead are you going? Breakfast. This sounds pretty heavy.

Well gee, I don't know. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Precisely. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

What? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Are those my clocks I hear? Yeah, gimme a Tab. What, what is it hot?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Watch it, Goldie. Hey. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. You'll find out in thirty years.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Oh. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Uh?

I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Who do you think, the Libyans. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Whoa, wait, Doc. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. We do now. Ah. Whoa. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. What did you say? Let's go. I'm gonna ram him. Stop it.

Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Leave her alone, you bastard. Calvin. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. George. George. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Is she pretty? Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. I said the keys are in here. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. What, I don't get what happened. Ahh.

Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Who is that guy. Right, and where am I gonna be? Do you mind if we park for a while? Oh yes sir.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. That's for messing up my hair. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. God dammit, I'm late. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Precisely.

Don't say a word. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Marty you gotta come back with me. No. George. George.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Uh, coast guard. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Yeah, who are you? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

Flux capacitor. Oh. Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Yoo. Your, your right. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Well, I figured, what the hell.

Yeah, well history is gonna change. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. The hell you doing to my car? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. I guarantee it.

He's your brother, Mom. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? What's going on? Where have you been all week? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Wait a minute. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? The future, it's where you're going? It's my dad. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?

Yeah. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Okay. Uncle Jailbird Joey?

Oh yes sir. Okay, but I don't know what to say. George. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Biff.

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. You got a permit for that? I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Scram, McFly. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Right about here.

Hello. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Leave her alone, you bastard. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Thank you. In about thirty years. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Next, please. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Right.

Crazy drunk drivers. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of-

Biff. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Jennifer. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Looks like a airplane, without wings.

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Yeah. Right about here.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Yeah, it's 8:00. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

Wait a minute. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.

I have to tell you about the future. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

Where the hell are they. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Next, please. That's a big bruise you have there. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

Ah, where're my pants? Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Are you sure about this storm? Stop it.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Who is that guy. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Calvin. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.

Ronald Reagon. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Yeah, it's 8:00. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Jennifer.

Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. You'll find out in thirty years. Well uh, good, fine. Where the hell are they.

Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Yeah, it's in the back. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

Wrecked? When did this happen and- It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Alright, we're the pinheads. Don't say a word. What?

Yeah, he's right here. Hello. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Lorenzo, where're you keys? Yoo.

Leave me alone. Alright, we're the pinheads. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. What a nightmare. Right.

Are you gonna order something, kid? Excuse me. Mom, Dad. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

Who? Just finishing up the second coat now. Why do you keep following me around? You'll find out. Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.

Where were we. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Without any sugar. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Thanks. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. What did you say?

You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Are those my clocks I hear? Children. I don't wanna see you in here again.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Calvin. No, not yet. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Yet.

Children. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Ahh. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two.

Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Jesus, you smoke too?

Hello. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. Are you gonna order something, kid? Nothing.

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Uh, well, I gotta go. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.

Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. I hope so. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? What? Ahh. Where? Back to the future.

Yeah. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Marty, is that you? In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Watch it, Goldie. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. You bet. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. You'll find out.

Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. That's George McFly. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Uh, I think so. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

No. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Watch it, Goldie. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Get your meat hooks off of me. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. You're George McFly. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? The flux capacitor.

Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Thanks. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. He's alright. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Working. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Marty, you made it.

Marty, are you alright? Huh? Ah, where're my pants? What the hell is a gigawatt? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

I'm gonna be at the dance. Who are you? C'mon, c'mon. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. That's George McFly?

I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Yeah, who are you? Whoa, wait, Doc.

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. We all make mistakes in life, children Don't say a word. Oh. This sounds pretty heavy.

Never? He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

Right check, Doc. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Where the hell are they. That's good advice, Marty. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Uh? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Stop it. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Next, please. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. That's right. Doc, is that a de- Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Right, and where am I gonna be? Maybe you were adopted. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? What, well you mean like a date?

There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. What's that thing he's on? Ahh. You don't understand. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

Science Fiction Theater. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? How about a ride, Mister? Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Yeah, where does he live?

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. I, I don't know. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.

I have a feeling too. I don't wanna see you in here again. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Right check, Doc.

I followed you. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Oh, what I meant to day was- He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Why not? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Now Biff, don't con me. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?

Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Marty. Marty. Marty. I haven't whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Hi, Marty. Huh? That's a big bruise you have there. Yeah okay. He's your brother, Mom.

I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. You have this thing hooked up to the car? That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- McFly. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. I don't wanna see you in here again. I followed you. Who do you think, the Libyans.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

I just wanna use the phone. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Why not? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. That ain't no airplane, look.

Are those my clocks I hear? Hey. Uh, well, I gotta go. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. What's that thing he's on?

Why not? Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. C'mon. What did I just say? George. George.

Right. Marty, you made it. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Where were we. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. No, Biff, you leave her alone.

Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Nothing. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Right. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Thanks a lot, kid.

Doc, is that a de- Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. No. Science Fiction Theater. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Who are you? Just finishing up the second coat now. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

That's George McFly? I haven't A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

What, I don't get what happened. Are you okay? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Well, they're bigger than me.

Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Let's get him. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. You broke it. Wow, look at him go.

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Thanks. Where were we. Yeah. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Hello. Wrecked?

Well uh, good, fine. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Bet your ass it works. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. No, not yet. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Why do you keep following me around?

What Lorraine, what? You too. Stop it. George, help me, please. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

Oh. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Jesus. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? He's a very strange young man.

Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. You got a permit for that? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. I have a feeling too. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. The future, it's where you're going? Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Yeah, where does he live?

Keys? About how far ahead are you going? Right, I got it. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Uh, I think so.

Yeah. Now Biff, don't con me. I haven't What the hell is this? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Marty. Marty. Marty. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. What's the meaning of this. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-

Yeah. Doc, wait. No, bastards. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Uh, well, I gotta go. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Well uh, good, fine. Right. Yeah. You're gonna be in the car with her. Doc.

yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Go. Go. Ah, where're my pants? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. Thanks.

He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Children. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

Well, this is a radiation suit. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Children.

You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Right.

Mom, is that you? Doc. McFly. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. You're George McFly.

Yeah, well history is gonna change. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Okay Doc, this is it. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

What, what, ma? Marty, is that you? Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Who is that guy. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hey boy, are you alright?

Where does he come from? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Well, I figured, what the hell. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

No, Biff, you leave her alone. What? Right about here. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?

Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Lorraine, are you up there? Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Excuse me.

C'mon. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Uh, Doc. Well uh, good, fine. This sounds pretty heavy.

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Unroll their fire. No.

No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Thanks, thanks a lot. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

Next, please. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Say that again. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Jesus. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Right, and where am I gonna be?

What, what is it hot? Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Stop it. Hi. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

Uncle Jailbird Joey? No. Right about here. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Well, Biff. No, Biff, you leave her alone. C'mon, c'mon let's go.

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. He's a peeping tom. Dad. The keys are in the trunk. Oh. Don't tell me anything.

Hey. I'll call you tonight. Who is that guy. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social-

Calvin. That's good advice, Marty. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Listen, Doc. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.

Back to the future. Stop it. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. She's just trying to keep you respectable. He's a very strange young man.

Uh, yeah. Wow, you must be rich. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Flux capacitor. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. Ronald Reagon. Well, they're bigger than me. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? What? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. I've gotta go.

Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Quiet. Children. He's an absolute dream. What?

What? We never would have fallen in love. Which one's your pop? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Marty, such a nice name.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Oh. I haven't The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.

Marty, you made it. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Yeah, exactly.

No. I hope so. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.

Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

McFly. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Yeah, who are you? That ain't no airplane, look.

Does your mom know about tomorrow night? So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Well, Biff. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Let's go. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- That ain't no airplane, look. I said the keys are in here. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- The storm.

Hello, Jennifer. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Yeah. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

The future, it's where you're going? Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Yoo. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Yeah, well history is gonna change. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Nothing. Damn. I'm late for school. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.

Doc. Uh, I think so. I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah okay. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

What? Well uh, good, fine. What, what is it hot? My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. No, Doc.

C'mon. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. No, not yet. Back to the future. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?

Save the clock tower. Oh. No. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Hello. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. What?

That's a big bruise you have there. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Yeah.

Bet your ass it works. I will. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

Who do you think, the Libyans. Quiet. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. What, what, ma? Oh. I'll call you tonight.

Jesus, you smoke too? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. The keys are in the trunk. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.

Stop it. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Yeah, gimme a Tab. I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. No, bastards. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Scram, McFly. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. The future, it's where you're going?

Oh, what I meant to day was- Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Wait a minute.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. I don't wanna see you in here again. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

Wow, you must be rich. And where's my reports? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- The storm.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. What did you sleep in your clothes again last night. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. God dammit, I'm late. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Ahh. Ahh. Lorenzo, where're you keys? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Go. Go. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. It's a board with wheels. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. I think we need a rematch. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Who's are these? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Breakfast.

Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? This is for all you lovers out there.

Who? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Yeah, gimme a Tab.

Stop it. No, bastards. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Right. Ahh. What? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Hey boy, are you alright? Uncle Jailbird Joey? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Leave her alone, you bastard. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

That ain't no airplane, look. The flux capacitor. I have to tell you about the future. What's that thing he's on? Where does he come from?

Yoo. Without any sugar. Doc. Ah. George. George.

Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- What the hell is a gigawatt? Well, this is a radiation suit. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

She's just trying to keep you respectable. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Children. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Watch it, Goldie.

Well, they're bigger than me. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Who are you? Ahh.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? It's my dad. I hope so. Science Fiction Theater. Doc, she didn't even look at him.

Flux capacitor. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. I can't play. Ah, where're my pants? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. You do? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Maybe you were adopted. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Because, you might regret it later in life. Thanks. Yeah.

David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Are you gonna order something, kid? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Just finishing up the second coat now.

Ahh. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Why not? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

Back to the future. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- That's right, he's gonna be mayor. What? I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. We all make mistakes in life, children Jesus, you smoke too? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Lorenzo, where're you keys? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. You're George McFly.

whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. What about George? Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Whoa, this is heavy. George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Hey boy, are you alright? Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Yeah. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Yeah. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

That's him. He's an absolute dream. Who? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.

That's him. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Why not? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Holy shit.

Oh. this has gotta be a dream. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Ahh. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. You're George McFly. Your, your right. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. God dammit, I'm late.

Uh, coast guard. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Yeah, I think maybe you do. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? What? I can't play. You got a permit for that? Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Excuse me.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. Doc.

Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Whoa, whoa, okay. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. It's my dad.

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Huh? Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. That's George McFly. Listen, Doc. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Okay Doc, this is it. Erased from existence. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. I think I know exactly what you mean.

I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Uh, I think so. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Yoo. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? What, well you mean like a date? I followed you.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Why is she gonna get angry with you? The hell you doing to my car? Flux capacitor.

Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. That's good advice, Marty. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc You do? What? Quiet.

Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Go. I can't play. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Why not?

Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Uh? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Which one's your pop? I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? He's a peeping tom. Dad.

Lorraine. What the hell is a gigawatt? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Never? I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Well, I figured, what the hell. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

Don't tell me anything. Yeah okay. Well gee, I don't know. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. this has gotta be a dream.

Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Mom, Dad. Thanks. George. George.

Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Well uh, good, fine. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Hey boy, are you alright?

You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Where the hell are they. How's your head?

Doc. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. No. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. The hell you doing to my car? I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Marty, you made it.

I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. You don't understand. Well, I figured, what the hell.

What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. He's an absolute dream. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. You'll find out.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. What the hell is this? Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Hey boy, are you alright?

George. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Wow, you must be rich. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. C'mon. Why not? You okay, is everything alright?

In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Uh, Doc. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Oh, what I meant to day was-

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Well, this is a radiation suit. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

That's George McFly? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Crazy drunk drivers. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

Mom, is that you? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Weight has nothing to do with it. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Yeah. Don't tell me anything. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Well gee, I don't know. What? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Are you okay? Yeah, exactly.

Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. Thank you. In about thirty years. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. What a nightmare.

Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. He's your brother, Mom. Hello. Erased from existence.

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Let's go. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Good morning.

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Yeah, he's right here. What's that thing he's on? You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.

What the hell is this? I just wanna use the phone. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Biff.

Huh? Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Right about here. It's a board with wheels. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.

Ronald Reagon. Yeah, who are you? Lorenzo, where're you keys? Quiet. Marty, such a nice name.

Because, you might regret it later in life. Well, Biff. Well, she's not doing a very good job. Never? Precisely.

I have to tell you about the future. Doc. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Let's get him. Nothing's coming to my mind. Science Fiction Theater. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Why is she gonna get angry with you?

No. You do? Right. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Excuse me.

What the hell is this? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Who do you think, the Libyans. The keys are in the trunk. What did your mother ever see in that kid?

Right, I got it. I guarantee it. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Yeah. Leave me alone.

Uh, yeah. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Don't say a word. Who, who? Are you gonna order something, kid?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Leave her alone, you bastard. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Excuse me. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. You know what I do in those situations? You got a permit for that? What did you say? No, why, what's a matter?

Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

Huh? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. I just wanna use the phone. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. What a nightmare. That's for messing up my hair.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Huh? Let's put him in there. You okay, is everything alright? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Yeah. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Jennifer. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.

Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. What? That's good advice, Marty.

Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. It's a board with wheels. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Ah.

Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Where does he come from? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Well, they're bigger than me. Lorraine. Okay Doc, this is it.

This sounds pretty heavy. You okay, is everything alright? What, what, ma? He's an absolute dream. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

Aw yeah, everything is great. And where's my reports? Yeah. Mom, is that you? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

Well, I figured, what the hell. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?

Let's put him in there. C'mon, c'mon. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Okay Doc, this is it.

Marty, is that you? David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda No, Biff, you leave her alone. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.

Because, you might regret it later in life. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Right check, Doc. Well, I figured, what the hell. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Really. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Are you gonna order something, kid? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Excuse me. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Yeah. I have a feeling too. I haven't Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Lorraine, are you up there?

Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Say that again. Who, who? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? I have to tell you about the future.

Do you mind if we park for a while? whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. What a nightmare. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

Leave me alone. Marty, you made it. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?

Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Yeah. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Well gee, I don't know.

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Science Fiction Theater. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Marty, will we ever see you again? My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Who do you think, the Libyans. What?

I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. The hell you doing to my car? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. What's that thing he's on?

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? Do you mind if we park for a while? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.

I'm gonna be at the dance. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. I haven't Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.

Hello. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Hello, Jennifer. Huh? Jesus.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. How's your head? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? No, Doc. I, I don't know.

I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. No, Doc. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? You'll find out in thirty years.

Marty, that was very interesting music. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Doc. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Jesus. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

What did your mother ever see in that kid? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Yeah. Unroll their fire. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. I'm gonna ram him. Scram, McFly.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Crazy drunk drivers. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.

Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Good morning. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Unroll their fire. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Doc. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

Yoo. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Okay. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.

What did I just say? Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. About how far ahead are you going? Never? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Are you okay? What did you say? Ahh. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Let's put him in there. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Look, you gotta listen to me. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

Whoa, whoa, okay. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. What was it, George, bird watching? It's my dad.

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. I have to tell you about the future. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Never mind that now, never mind that now. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Right. How's your head?

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Who are you? Marty, will we ever see you again? Ahh. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Uh, look me up when you get there. Yeah, exactly. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Ahh. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. Biff. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Don't say a word.

Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. You're George McFly. You know what I do in those situations? The future, it's where you're going?

It's my dad. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Hello. What was it, George, bird watching? Leave her alone, you bastard.

Jesus. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- We all make mistakes in life, children I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Oh. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Yeah. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Hi. Yeah.

Wait a minute. I can't play. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. No, why, what's a matter?

Who? Okay. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Where? Who, who?

Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? How's your head? That's a big bruise you have there. I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Watch it, Goldie. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Doc. Ah well, sort of.

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. What, I don't get what happened. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. I think we need a rematch. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.

I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. That's him. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Breakfast. What's a rerun?

Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. I'll get it back to you, alright? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. Doc. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Uh, look me up when you get there. What? Marty, will we ever see you again? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.

Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Marty, you made it. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Precisely. Ah. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

And where's my reports? The keys are in the trunk. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. What you got under here? Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Really. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. What the hell is a gigawatt? What the hell is a gigawatt? The future, it's where you're going? Alright, we're the pinheads.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Jesus. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Your, your right. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Doc. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

Thanks. No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Stop it. About how far ahead are you going?

Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Children. We all make mistakes in life, children Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

No. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. Doc, is that a de- Yeah. Jesus.

No. Uh, coast guard. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. No. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

Precisely. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

He's an absolute dream. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. The storm. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Nothing.

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Oh. No. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

George. George. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Are those my clocks I hear?

I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Jesus, you smoke too? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Marty, such a nice name.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Okay Doc, this is it. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. The hell you doing to my car?

Excuse me. Yeah, exactly. Ohh, no. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Lorenzo, where're you keys? What the hell is a gigawatt? No, not yet. Your, your right.

Doc, she didn't even look at him. Oh. Aw yeah, everything is great. This is for all you lovers out there. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. George: you ever think of running for class president?

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- I've gotta go. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Well gee, I don't know. Oh. C'mon, c'mon let's go. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. We do now. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Marty, are you alright?

Say that again. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. We never would have fallen in love. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Who? Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. What, I don't get what happened. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

George: you ever think of running for class president? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. That's him.

The hell you doing to my car? Alright, punk, now- That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Who are you?

Ohh, no. It's my dad. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

What? Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

What? Yeah. Doc, you gotta help- What's that thing he's on? Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Marty, that was very interesting music. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Just finishing up the second coat now. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. You're gonna be in the car with her.

Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Breakfast. Whoa, whoa, okay. Ohh, no.

Right. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Okay, but I don't know what to say. Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Uh, Doc. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Let's get him.

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Doc. Look, you gotta listen to me. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

That's him. What? You bet. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.

Go. What? Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Yeah.

The hell you doing to my car? Who is that guy. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Erased from existence. What?

No, Doc. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Listen, Doc. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

Holy shit. What did I just say? We do now. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Look, you gotta listen to me. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? What Lorraine, what? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

Get your meat hooks off of me. Okay. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Perfect, just perfect.

Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.

Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Where? Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

Excuse me. You okay, is everything alright? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. That's George McFly.

C'mon. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Ah well, sort of. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. I've gotta go.

Watch it, Goldie. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Looks like a airplane, without wings. Well, I guess that's everything. It's my dad.

Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

Ahh. Ahh. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Ah. Whoa. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. Sit here, Marty.

That's George McFly? So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Huh? What, what is it hot? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. What, what is it hot?

Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Leave her alone, you bastard. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. What about George?

Right, gimme a Pepsi free. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. That ain't no airplane, look. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Doc. It's my dad. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Doc.

Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Yeah. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Jennifer.

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. The future, it's where you're going?

Oh, yeah, yeah. About how far ahead are you going? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Nothing. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.

I will. Why not? You don't understand. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.

George. Huh? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Excuse me. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Don't say a word. Right. What, what? Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?

I don't wanna see you in here again. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? You okay, is everything alright? Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Yeah.

Ah, where're my pants? He's an absolute dream. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Um, yeah, I'm on my way. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Biff. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.

That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Huh? Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Ahh. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Right about here. Hello. Lorraine, are you up there? Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Right. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Doc. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Why not? Okay. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. George. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Jesus.

Ah well, sort of. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? That's George McFly? Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Yeah.

The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Doc? Uh, well, I gotta go. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Uh, Doc.

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. I think I know exactly what you mean. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Doc, you gotta help- You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. It's about the future, isn't it?

Marty, why are you so nervous? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Nothing.

Yoo. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. Thanks a lot, kid.

Its good. Yeah, sure, okay. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Doc, is that a de-

Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Yeah, who are you?

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Marty, why are you so nervous? Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Oh. Weight has nothing to do with it.

Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. C'mon, c'mon let's go. This is for all you lovers out there. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? You okay, is everything alright? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. What? Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Ah. Whoa. Excuse me.

What, what is it hot? Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Yeah okay. I said the keys are in here. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Hi, Marty.

Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. What did your mother ever see in that kid? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. Hello.

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? George. George. Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Okay. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Who's are these? Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories. Marty, that was very interesting music. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. I've gotta go. Ahh. That ain't no airplane, look. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Yet. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. George: you ever think of running for class president? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. He's a very strange young man. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. We never would have fallen in love. Excuse me.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Marty, will we ever see you again? Where? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Ah, where're my pants?

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Let's get him. this has gotta be a dream. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear? What? Stop it. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

Doc, you gotta help- Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. What's with the life preserver? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Who is that guy.

Excuse me. Hi, Marty. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Whoa, whoa, okay.

Wait a minute. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

Yeah. Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind- Uh, well, I gotta go. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Whoa, this is heavy.

Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Right. Never? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. No.

My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Precisely. Oh.

Marty you gotta come back with me. Wrecked? Excuse me. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? In that case, I'll tell you strait out.

Okay Doc, this is it. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? What about George? What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

I just wanna use the phone. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Looks like a airplane, without wings. Marty, will we ever see you again? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.

Doc, is that a de- Well, this is a radiation suit. What a nightmare. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? And where's my reports?

He's your brother, Mom. It's my dad. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Precisely. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.

You'll find out in thirty years. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. What's the meaning of this.

It's a board with wheels. Okay, but I don't know what to say. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? I have to tell you about the future.

Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Ahh.

What the hell is a gigawatt? This is for all you lovers out there. Mom, is that you? Wow, you must be rich. Right, I got it.

Excuse me. Will you take care of that? Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

No, Doc. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Wrecked? Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

That's a great idea. I'd love to park. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.

Why am I always the last one to know about these things. It's a board with wheels. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? George. Stop it.

I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. We never would have fallen in love. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. Holy shit.

He's a peeping tom. Dad. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Ah, honey, your first novel. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. No, why, what's a matter?

Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

Doc. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Yeah. Yeah, who are you? George.

No. It's a board with wheels. No, why, what's a matter? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. Doc? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Whoa, wait, Doc.

Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television. Huh? Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Say that again.

Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Working. Well, I guess that's everything. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? What?

C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Never mind that now, never mind that now. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor. Yeah well, you shouldn't drink. You're gonna be in the car with her. Oh.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Are you gonna order something, kid? Well, Biff. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Stop it. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.

Quiet. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Jesus.

Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Because, you might regret it later in life.

Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Ronald Reagon. What, what?

I will. Okay. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Hello, Jennifer. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

The hell you doing to my car? Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. That's him. No. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?

Yeah, it's 8:00. What's going on? Where have you been all week? What about George? Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Uh, yeah.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Yoo. Uh, look me up when you get there. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

Scram, McFly. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Alright, I'm ready. Whoa, this is heavy. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Oh yes sir. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? Right, I got it.

Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Yeah, it's 8:00.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. What? Oh.

Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Um, well it's a delorean, right? What the hell is this? Take care. Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Marty. Marty. Marty. Yeah, sure, okay. I have a feeling too. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Yoo.

Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Leave me alone. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. That's for messing up my hair.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. George. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. I guarantee it.

Oh. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Yeah okay. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. No, not yet.

Nothing's coming to my mind. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Who are you? Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

What? Erased from existence. Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Mom, Dad. Good morning.

That's George McFly. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Whoa, wait, Doc. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

Yeah, it's 8:00. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Stop it. You'll find out in thirty years. See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.

Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. This sounds pretty heavy. The storm. Doc, you gotta help- Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Go. You bet. Ah well, sort of.

Look, you gotta listen to me. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Precisely.

Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Excuse me. Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

What? Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. We all make mistakes in life, children

Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Yeah. Oh. Are you gonna order something, kid? That's for messing up my hair.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

He's a very strange young man. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. How's your head? We do now.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Ah. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Right. Holy shit.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. You okay, is everything alright? Jesus.

Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Wrecked? When did this happen and- Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. What?

George. George. No, why, what's a matter? They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Uh, well, I gotta go. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Weight has nothing to do with it. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Uh?

The future, it's where you're going? Save the clock tower. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. What, what, ma? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. I just wanna use the phone. You okay, is everything alright? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

You okay, is everything alright? Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Huh? Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

Hello, Jennifer. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Jennifer. You'll find out. Oh.

Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Save the clock tower. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Just finishing up the second coat now. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

I have a feeling too. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Don't tell me anything. Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? You're gonna be in the car with her. Hi. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. No. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. I have to tell you about the future. He's an absolute dream. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Is she pretty?

One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. You too. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Jesus, you smoke too?

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? George. George. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Well uh, good, fine.

And where's my reports? Uncle Jailbird Joey? I said the keys are in here. Just finishing up the second coat now. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. I have a feeling too.

That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Quiet. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? That's him.

Why do you keep following me around? Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? I have to tell you about the future. Next, please. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? What? I hope so. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?

Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Mom, is that you?

Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? Marty, are you alright? Yeah, where does he live? Whoa, whoa, okay. You'll find out.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? You got a permit for that?

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Sit here, Marty. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. You okay, is everything alright?

What Lorraine, what? A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Whoa, wait, Doc. Yeah. this has gotta be a dream.

Hey boy, are you alright? Oh. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Huh? Which one's your pop?

Uh, look me up when you get there. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Don't tell me anything. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.

Erased from existence. Calvin. Oh. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? No, Doc.

They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Go. What about George? Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Right about here.

Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Without any sugar.

Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Nothing. Right about here. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Bet your ass it works. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Right.

I guarantee it. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. I will. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Yeah, who are you?

He's alright. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. I said the keys are in here. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Doc, you gotta help- Hi, Marty. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. I can't play.

Calvin. Shit. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Wow, you must be rich. Alright, punk, now-

Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Okay, but I don't know what to say. What about George? Just finishing up the second coat now. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?

A colored mayor, that'll be the day. Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. You'll find out.

That ain't no airplane, look. I will. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. What about George? Ahh. Ahh.

Breakfast. Take care. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Damn. I'm late for school. No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. What? Hello, Jennifer. Next, please. What about George?

This sounds pretty heavy. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. You know what I do in those situations? No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. How's your head? Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Ah. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Doc, you gotta help- Now Biff, don't con me. Hello.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. What? Hello. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Oh, what I meant to day was- I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Don't tell me anything. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Marty, are you alright? Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. I, I don't know. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Yeah, where does he live? Right. What? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.

You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Watch it, Goldie. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Stop it. I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. What? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. It's a board with wheels. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Look, you gotta listen to me. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?

Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

Wrecked? Precisely. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. What, what? Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

Well, I figured, what the hell. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. You're gonna be in the car with her. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.

Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Ah, where're my pants? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Nothing.

Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Jennifer. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Why not? Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

I have to tell you about the future. Unroll their fire. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.

Where the hell are they. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Who? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?

Biff. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. What the hell is a gigawatt? Alright, I'm ready. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Did you hurt your head? yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

What, what, ma? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Are you gonna order something, kid?

Doc. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. Right. This is for all you lovers out there. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Right. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Alright, take it up, go. Doc. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Well uh, good, fine. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.

Marty, is that you? Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Nothing. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social- Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

Jesus, you smoke too? You'll find out. I have to tell you about the future. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Marty, is that you? Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Quiet. Why is she gonna get angry with you? Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating? After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Marty, that was very interesting music.

Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer. Maybe you were adopted. Let's get him. Marty, are you alright? Your, your right.

Ah, honey, your first novel. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. What's with the life preserver?

C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. You bet. Marty, such a nice name. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Excuse me.

Marty, why are you so nervous? you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. We never would have fallen in love. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Flux capacitor. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Yeah, sure, okay. Doc, you gotta help-

Ronald Reagon. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?
